# CannonGame
This is a small Java Swing-based game that my group worked on for CprE 186 at Iowa State University. The class was a semester long, project based class. Myself and three other people created this game.

There is a release in this repo that can be downloaded and run to play the game. Java 8+ is required to run the game. It is quite difficult. Controls are presented on the start screen.
